# <!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration, not a tag. It tells web browsers in which HTML version the document is written. This should always be the first line in an HTML document.

# <head> is the opening tag that serves as a container for the setup elements. Jupyter Notebook imports occur in the top cell whereas Python imports occur at the top of the code. HTML imports (e.g., a stylesheet or a library) will be within the <head>.

# <meta> is short for "metadata" and tells the web browser basic information, such as page width.

# <title> and </title> are the opening and closing tags that serve as a container for the page title displayed on the tab at the top of your web browser. In the example above, the title is "Document" and would appear like so in the browser:
# </head> is the closing tag for the <head> tag, much like the end of a code block in Python.

    # <body> and </body> are opening and closing tags. They also serve as a container, but for data we can see (navigation menus, lists, and paragraphs).
    
    # <html lang=”en”> and </html> are opening and closing tags that serve as a container for all elements within an HTML page.

# <h1 /> is a first-level header. The text in this tag will be displayed bigger and bolder than the rest of the page's text. There are many different headers available to use, from h1 to h6, with h1 returning the largest text.
# <p /> is a paragraph tag, currently holding lorem ipsum sentences. (lorem ipsum is dummy text used to stage websites). More can be read about it on the Lorem Ipsum reference website (Links to an external site.).
# <ul /> is an unordered list.
# <li /> is a list item.
